# Training_Data Information

The training data used in this project has been generated by MATLAB, saved as .csv files and .mat files and organized into folders here depending on the model for which it was created. These folders are:
  * _Line_Cut_: This model uses simulated line cut spectroscopy data perpendicular to a solid wall of CO molecules.
  * _Circle_Spec_: This model uses simulated spectroscopy data at the center of a solid-walled circle of CO molecules. For this system we do not have corresponding experimental data. 
  * _Hexagon_: This model uses simulated spectroscopy data at the center of a solid-walled hexagon of CO molecules built with the same proportions as the one we assembled within the STM. 
  * _Graphene_: This model uses simulated spectroscopy data at the "top" and "bond" site of a synthetic graphene lattice, which we compare to experimental data taken when Ken worked at Stanford.
