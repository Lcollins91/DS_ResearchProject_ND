# DS_ResearchProject_ND

### Project Objective
In this project, we aim to develop machine learning models to improve the selection of parameters for our experimental simulations. We have created various training data sets in MATLAB, extracted features from the training data and exported those features as .csv files. We then use Jupyter notebooks and Python to develop machine learning models to predict the phase used in the simulations based on these features, so that eventually we can input the experimental data into these ML models and determine the phase in our experimental system. Determining this phase accurately will allow us to better compare our experimental results to simulations.
